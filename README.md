# 🌾 Crop Sustainability Dashboard

An interactive data visualization dashboard that explores crop productivity, soil quality, and sustainability metrics using synthetic data. This project is designed for data storytelling and technical evaluation purposes.

## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard uses synthetic datasets to simulate real-world agricultural conditions and visualize:

- **Crop yield distributions** across types and regions.
- **Soil sustainability** scores by climate zone.
- **Nutrient concentrations** based on soil quality.
- **Yield trends** over time.
- **Crop health** proportions.
- **Correlation heatmaps** for nutrient and sustainability interactions.

The goal is to present these indicators through a professional-quality dashboard using Plotly Dash.
